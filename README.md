## About this repo

This is the collection of Wireshark Profiles I'm using. Feel free to use them if you find them useful

## Note

All the current profiles I'm using are based on the fantastic profiles that can be downloaded from this repository: https://www.cellstream.com/resources/wireshark-profiles-repository

I have my own GitHub repo because I like to tweak them to fit my own needs.

I extended WLAN-detail profile with the filters described in https://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-features/33195-wi-fi-roaming-secrets-revealed?start=1
